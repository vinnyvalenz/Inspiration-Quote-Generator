because i wished to live d if you love life don t waste time for time i a man sooner or later discovers that he is the all the art of living lies in a fine mingling good friends good books and a sleepy conscien our life always expresses the result of our do we need to give each other the space to grow he who has a why to live can bear almost any how a baby is god s opinion that life should go on to live a pure unselfish life one must count remember when life s path is steep to keep you life is like dancing if we have a big floor when we remember we are all mad the mysteries life is a succession of lessons which must be we must be willing to let go of the life we ha the price of anything is the amount of life yo don t go through life grow through life life is percent what you make it and pe the privilege of a lifetime is being who you are it is not length of life but depth of life every creature is better alive than dead men don t let life discourage you everyone who got here is the test to find whether your mission i slept and dreamt that life was joy i awoke a person will sometimes devote all his life to there are three constants in life change c it s all about quality of life and finding a h life is not a problem to be solved but a real my life is my message the true secret of happiness lies in taking a i love those who yearn for the impossible i love life because what more is there i don t believe people are looking for the mea life consists not in holding good cards but in life loves the liver of it nothing in life is to be feared it is only to once you say you re going to settle for second life is far too important a thing ever to talk the courage of life is often a less dramatic s i do not regret one moment of my life our life is what our thoughts make it beware the barrenness of a busy life the shoe that fits one person pinches another everything has been figured out except how to the only disability in life is a bad attitude if life were predictable it would cease to be who will tell whether one happy moment of love when life is too easy for us we must beware o i think i ve discovered the secret of life y what we think determines what happens to us s doing what you love is the cornerstone of havi everything in life is luck use your health even to the point of wearing life is a series of collisions with the future with the past i have nothing to do nor with t the story of life is quicker then the blink of most people have never learned that one of the the aim of life is to live and to live means life consists in what a man is thinking of all not life but good life is to be chiefly valued life becomes harder for us when we live for ot a life is not important except in the impact i i have found that if you love life life will may you live all the days of your life a healthful hunger for a great idea is the bea life does not cease to be funny when people di to affect the quality of the day that is the life is a tragedy when seen in close up but a the art of living is more like wrestling than begin at once to live and count each separate look i don t want to wax philosophic but i w when i hear somebody sigh life is hard i a people living deeply have no fear of death a well spent day brings happy sleep fortunately analysis is not the only way to re life in abundance comes only through great love the greatest discovery of my generation is tha what is important in life is life and not the you have succeeded in life when all you really an aim in life is the only fortune worth finding i look back on my life like a good day s work while there s life there s hope get correct views of life and learn to see th life is a long lesson in humility life is half spent before we know what it is life must be lived as play maybe all one can do is hope to end up with th there is only one difference between a long li one way to get the most out of life is to look kindness i ve discovered is everything in life unbeing dead isn t being alive to change ones life start immediately do it life appears to me too short to be spent in nu this life is worth living we can say since i life is pleasant death is peaceful it s the the purpose of life is a life of purpose we are all here for a spell get all the good the greatest pleasure of life is love the great use of life is to spend it for somet our business in life is not to succeed but to the good life is one inspired by love and guid while we are postponing life speeds by there is just one life for each of us our own the basic fact about human existence is not th a chain is no stronger than its weakest link life is never easy for those who dream life is too short to work so hard the chief danger in life is that you may take we are here to add what we can to life not to for the happiest life days should be rigorous life well spent is long if you live long enough you ll make mistakes life is something to do when you can t get to life isn t a matter of milestones but of mome we can t plan life all we can do is be availa life will always be to a large extent what we life is wasted on the living life has meaning only if one barters it day by the art of life is to know how to enjoy a litt the most exhausting thing in life is being ins the main facts in human life are five birth life is a succession of moments to live each there is

electrical thing about movies i make movies i want to see citizen kane is perhaps the one american talki movies are something people see all over the w movies are an art form that is very available movies are a complicated collision of literatu every single art form is involved in film in when you make a film you usually make a film a i was obsessed with romance when i was in hig and in movies you must be a gambler to produc movies are not scripts movies are films they i just like movies that somehow expose the wor i ve always been an animal lover i ve grown u sometimes in movies i still have to be the he nobody makes movies bad on purpose home alone was a movie not an alibi jerry o i am in so many movies that are on tv at i ve been really enjoying writing articles and i worked very hard on those movies but there w i can be in movies but i ll never be an ac my dream role would probably be a psycho kille in life and in movies it s a similar challeng sex is a doorway to something

going to see mov nowadays it seems more and more like the busi even in india the hindi film industry might be i remember being on film sets when i was young becoming emancipated at my life wasn t nor i love doing normal things movies shopping you know i think the film business is its own later on they send me to hollywood to make mo the next thing i knew i was out of the servic if there s specific resistance to women making everyone related to me in my circle was from c my whole life has been movies and religion th very often i ve known people who wouldn t say i ve seen many many movies over the years an i think less is more when it comes to kissing i m doing les miserables the movie i ve do i have done many movies that people hadn t see the best movies are simple nobody makes movies like oliver stone i m not a strikingly handsome guy but i m in i was always raised on cowboy films and then basically there s not enough sex in movies t you know those movies where the people in the i sure lost my musical direction in hollywood those movies sure got me into a rut too much tv hurts movies funny things happen to you in movies for silly january is the garbage can of movies in americ my wife comes with me on all the movies but s my mother had to send me to the movies with my i don t know what it was maybe the movie thea i never really got nightmares from movies in i don t want to criticize any other designers even the worst bond movies there s something i see a lot of movies i love films as a spect where i come from it was a heresy to say you my children have never watched any of my films i m not an admirer of action movies i just th how do people relate to movies now when they economically it s more expensive to make movi in life single women are the most vulnerable i still like the run and gun action movies and when i was a little boy i used to borrow my fa frankly i got into the movies because i like i really don t have favorites i m just a fan o hollywood is throwing action movies at me i had done some flimflam movies but i didn t before schindler s list i wouldn t have bel a lot of the struggle i had with movies is i r you take somebody that cries their goddam eyes sure twilight is really huge right now and i go to the movies a lot and i regret when i i live very normally i go out with my friends bruce lee was very famous i watched his movie when we talk about how movies used to be made the whole world loves american movies blue je in the past i ve made movies that were pretty i look at american movies the big muscles an i have a lot of repression so repression is w i think a lot of people do big movies not beca thinking back to those earlier days i felt i making movies is a way of understanding myself after making several tragic movies in a row i d is quite a lot more advanced in animated mo i have a very busy life and not many people w i knew that there were black people in africa my family and our neighbors and friends though i like to hang out with my friends i love mus i think that s what distinguishes schmidt rea movies make you immortal and ageless i grew up watching all these crazy movies eur i don t like comedy i like funny things i do for me the greatest source of income is still i will make action movies i think for a few sometimes when we weep in the movies we weep f if people are constantly reading about you an i think it s better to be involved in one or t they say i can open movies and that s nice in making movies is not rocket science it s abou i ve made so many movies playing a hooker that and what i like about it is it makes me happy now on friday nights if i want to go hang out i ve had some movies that have been ridiculed i wasn t allowed to go to movies when i was ki i don t want to make movies for kids and i do robots have a rich and storied history in movies what people adore about superhero movies is th well everyone likes movies when they re a lit i made two movies before the police had a hit i have realized that i hate going to the premi i do love the films i ve done in the past i w i played winnie cooper on the wonder years f i used to love to go to the movies i d see t even when i was a little kid i always said i i really like children to watch my movies i ve choreographed all of my movies when i got depressed i watched bruce lee movi most of the time it s the role sometimes it s it can have an enormous effect because big bud people need to start to think about the messag any time you stop looking at evil as a black a the movies i made early on may not have been g movies such as mr smith goes to washington i do not quote my own movies i think i would people don t have these tidy little redemption i m not an especially highbrow person but i h i don t know why but i ve always been a sucke oh i adored mickey mouse when i was a child going to the movies was a big event in my yout you can t work in the movies movies are all a i like very much to do movies i like to direct movies but i don t like to g quite often a lot of the work i had done had you have to read scripts and audition and deve more and more major businesses and industries steven spielberg is unique i feel that the ki when newspapers started to publish the box off i wanted to write and direct movies and not be i m no longer dependent on the movie business i ve been offered lots of movies there s alwa people feel the worst film i made was jack i m not mad about movies there are too many p i had to act in a school play when i was about i like being in movies that have a great story i mean i love l a i love living here but it s not like i sit around watching my movies it s a funny thing you want so badly for peop very often when i go in to meet for movies or i love movies that make me cry because they r the reason i chose the movies that i did was b i mean why am i considered an it girl beca it s like why people read scary books or go se i wanted to be in jim carrey comedy movies bef i wouldn t like to be in movies movie people i love scary movies i like blood and gore an my movies just kind of sneak up on you i don i m not looking to get away from anything i l kids end up seeing my movies anyway but some o i like movies i can relate to i don t know many women who can relate to shar there are some movies that i would like to for i feel like a lot of the female relationships i spent all my time on my movies worried that movies are movies and i don t think any of th i like the george romero films which were rea i love these movies where it s just about the it seems to me that one thing people do over a the movies have got more corporate they re ma usually i do everything reverse i practice so i don t want to produce anymore small or indep i was never into the popular school or clique my dad had a commercial film company so he ha i think being self referential is really narci it s like those high school yearbook photos th most movies once the action starts there s no being alone is scarier than any boogey man and you go back to those films of the s and i go off and make movies i come home and i m the financial implode is bound to be reflected a huge part of acting in movies is appetite y obviously i m attracted to heavier movies i want to be in movies that stand the test of ultimately to have a career in movies to a c a lot of times you get credit for stuff in you in the rodgers and hammerstein generation pop you re creating new things in movies and peopl when you re making movies you ve got to get ob i guess you could say i ve been in my share of i was sick and tired of being an english actor i always wanted to make movies if i wanted to make spy movies for the rest of some people think literature is high culture a it s the contemporary woman that movies don t people talk about mumblecore but i prefer bumb i have a great job writing for the office b woody allen is really the ultimate i love tha i think these movies are as much for people of i m not a film buff i don t watch a lot of mo growing up i didn t watch movies it s simple you get a part you play a part i tend to think of action movies as exuberant i made some truly awful movies stop or my m now if you are like me if you are like prac movies were never an art form they were enter i m not impressed by someone s degree i m i i love horror i love scary movies i love thr although charismatic james dean is no harriso i think we re very complicated and we re capab i think it s more interesting to see people wh a lot of action movies today seem to have scen how many movies do you see when you can say th i have three kids who like harry potter so i w the movies i watch and the music i listen to a we can now have action movies with two stars w i just knew that was what i wanted to do i wa i feel i want to grow as an actress and be bet no but way before that i ve been doing littl i ve made movies that we re very successful th my favorite characters are the ones that are t i think that if i had grown up and had been in i ve made three musical movies which is pretty when videotape came so a lot of movies that i i think if you do something effectively whethe i have been in movies that i thought i wasn t i make movies that nobody will see i ve made i used to be prettier than i am but i think i i ve made movies that i thought were good i v i aim for a lifetime full of movies i don t know why i don t watch a lot of movies it was like in samoa when they d put up a movi and being as i m somebody who loves movies lik in terms of the romantic kind of lead i just there are movies that require fantasy and slig i like the idea of movies having a magic eleme i don t get it when you get so much openness a i always leave that for other people to decide i m so grateful for what disney gave me and th i can t watch scary movies right now because where i live nobody who s fourteen is having there are movies where we are interested in se i tend to make low budget movies but yeah i the best movies have one sentence that they re being the son of a filmmaker you are aware of i want my movies to be audience experiences a there are only so many movies you can direct i m trying to figure myself out through my mov there certainly is no secret in that there are i hate movies that tell people what to think i m not going to have a perfect career it s b as far as writing i like watching bad movies i think romance is a tool comedy is a tool an i hear the way people talk about the children i m not michael moore i think michael moore w well toronto i consider to be the birthplace i work constantly but i work at a lot of diffe there are characters in movies who i call fil people used to be funny about approaching me you have to understand that crew members make what i like to do is just make good music goo i don t wanna abandon my identity as ll cool j the person that made me want to make movies a i play xbox i have a little boy to look after i ve turned down twentysomething million dolla you make movies for the people if critics hap when you go to the movies with your whole fami but then i go through long periods where i don i remember looking through magazines or watchi a lot of movies treat kids like idiots i ve always wanted to make movies i think ever since i was preteen i wanted to d i want to make timeless movies when i started to watch some of the films i d making movies is difficult and you get disorie i ve done many different movies in many differ listen i think movies serve many different pu i cry a lot you know which is very difficult there are some movies that i would like to for i remember being a kid and sleeping over at my the nature of the movies is different than it it s just as hard staying happily married a i ve made over movies and of them are good the nature of motion capture is only going to i hadn t made a big budget film and in hollyw i think i took my eye off the ball from about i ve been involved with violent movies and th we didn t care if we were well liked as long a when we talk about oscars it s almost as a sy last year when black swan true grit and my movies are important on an economic basis when people ask me what makes movies great it all my movies got screwed up because of my per over the years with movies i ve given directo audiences want to see intelligent movies you know my movies are important on an econom i ve had such a great track record in making a all my life i have loved and been inspired by well i think one of the main things that you i was so young and making movies going to th i m an actor and i guess i ve done so many mo movies are open doors and at every door i ch i just think old old movies they make you con i love huge movies not sure i am the guy to m actors are steeped in a world of agents and wh i love watching the bond movies obviously and people say you never remember anybody who dies i like action movies even though i think acti movies about space raise those questions of wh all i do is go to the movies i like all of the mental psychological thrill i would do anything for a part nearly anythin critics can be harsh and i think it s going to i don t make movies thinking oh this is goi sundance is weird the movies are weird you i like the good feeling movies i don t stop it s my nature people have to t i love john waters there s stuff in it that s i ll probably pursue doing more movies but no i want to make all kinds of movies i do want i do like to move and get physical in my movies i m an enormous admirer of christopher lee he i have eclectic tastes in the movies i want to i don t want to just do independent movies and i m the first to admit that i like going to o i may be alone in this but i do sense the pow i like fantasy i like horror science fiction i care about the connection with the audience i do enjoy animated movies you don t want to be photographed you don t w i haven t deliberately set out to play the blo i actually think i have an audience member s s i enjoy sports i get a real joy from playing i m proud of all the movies i ve made they re when i make a film i m away from home for two there are a lot of things that come to bear on i m glad movies aren t going to please everybo i like four hour movies i ve never really broken this down before but and i love mel brooks my dad loved his movies i mean i kind of remember i m now so i i do like escapism i like going to the movies i want to make movies that pierce people s hea when we shoot there are so many things i h there are a lot of movies i d like to throw aw i crave working on those small independent mov lord of the rings was my first experience maki the truth is i found myself doing these huge yeah i mean the material directors the othe i ve done movies with a sword before but i ha movies like that aren t about the visual effec just because you ve made a couple movies you people wrestle sometimes making movies and i i like making movies for myself and my friends i just love movies there s this index that tallies up how much yo i couldn t survive just doing independent movi i didn t know what types of movies i wanted to i just want to keep doing what i m doing and h i grew up when i was when i had my first op i like to think the movies that i ve picked ha i loved old black and white movies especially i had a daughter who was years old and i had and if people come up and say they like the mo the thing about the uk is we don t really make it s something i never dreamed i d be doing m jet was very busy i ve been inspired by a lot hollywood has the idea that movies have to be i don t blame folks for not wanting to put me if the goal is to get the best artists actors movies are different from real life i mean movies in general tend to sort of port even today in our progressive times in most there s an absolute prejudice that good movies i was a very interested arts student i was al a lot of people just go to movies that feed in class is often invisible in america in the mov movies absorb our attention more completely i the movies that are made more thoughtfully or when my mother got home from work she would t it s never really that much fun for me to do m my childhood was influenced by the roles my fa i remember saying goodbye to my father the nig de niro was a hero of mine and sean penn but i rarely see one of the summer blockbuster m i took acting classes in college and once i g i was watching up in the air and i thought the physical part of comedy is as hard as a lo my passion is doing movies and as long as i k my passion is doing movies so as long as i ke i m fed up with the idiots the ever widenin reality tv looks more like america than movies i m a weird big guy doing rapping doing movi i ve played a lot of mothers in my movies there really are three types of religious mo i for one am tired of seeing movies about me i am a filmmaker that is all i ve ever been why be boring have some fun rock shows shoul even if we die at we re still dying young i m a big fan of vampire movies generally and before i d written movies i never could do bi my interest in film is sort of catholic apar i definitely have found a balance i ve had so i love going to movies i grew up on bette davis movies and marlene d i don t think we re living in great times for you have to get the audience invested even if if you really want to be competitive in today and you also have to do movies that are about the movies people don t talk about or remember billions of people have seen and been influenc well it was actually i brought the idea of i find that when you see somebody in the tablo i m not sure anybody s ready to see me in a dr there are a lot of movies i ve done that come i don t generally do movies that get good revi i was a total athlete i loved sports but whe working on the ice age movies i m really pr the irony is that you can t use real rain to m my bar for being successful is being able to d i can t do the same movies all my life i m co i ve been on so many movies generally i have a guide to recognizing your saints was the fi i still think that movies are amazing i respec the reason i keep making movies is i hate the i don t really make movies because i want to s you see so many earnest characters in movies a the only reason why i would like to be accepte i happen to be interested in watching a face a people pay to see movies with women looking be awards were made in hollywood in whatever the some quality performances and movies have a ch i don t really care where movies come from as now there are so many movies so many festiva bond is the longest running franchise ever and i m a fan of action movies i think what s dangerous about being an actor i missed out on everything sometimes on the s i really don t like to do back to back movies usually when you see females in movies they f i think what a lot of action movies lose these with the cgi suddenly there s a thousand enem if military movies were automatically successf i love vampire movies i think they are sexy yes i m going to be the president of the unit i kinda see my current position like this her the one benefit of having done all kinds of mo you re basically the sum of all the experience not that it entirely matters there is a perce my movies are unadorned they re not particula i knew i had to get out of boston and stop mak i ve never held myself up particularly high wh you don t go to the movies to do historical re making movies is a very different experience i as much as i hate his movies oliver stone has i write plays and movies i live and work at t i just love movies so suddenly you re politi i always always meant to be on stage i only on radio and television magazines and the mov i really care about this stuff i care about m i love movies with spectacle but spectacle can i hope to make movies that are so small they d i have nothing against d in theory but i ve when i was a kid going into the movies you we when i was a little kid and even still i l making movies was more a reaction to not being i don t see that many movies lately that are a i feel like i m a fighter i ve fought my whol i appreciate a slow burn romance in most movi i really unfortunately don t have tons of hila i was influenced when i was younger by the car movies these days have made killers into funny i m a movie nut i go to the movies probably t i think there s a vague sense out there that m i ve always been a movie guy movies have been you know when hollywood does a great big block but in the back of my mind i ve always looked to be honest i don t enjoy watching movies mu i go to the movies at least five times a week but most good movies have a gun in them well getting behind the camera is something i the way i look at it movies are a different m i love doing roles and movies that are differe in all honesty i think that i ve had a very no there s definitely a large fan base for the t i like simple things i like to sneak in the t if i did any movies i d have to take a break f not everybody goes to movies to get their life the music led to the acting but movies aren t i quit doing the movies because the wrestling shooting this one was kind of like a two month comedy it was just huge in my house peter se i grew up in toronto and as long as i can reme i really don t have any solutions and i don t i ve kind of come to the conclusion that what in a lot of movies especially big studio ones i m very particular about the kind of music th movies as evidenced by a chorus of protesting i m blessed to have cool roles in these big mo there s too much down time making movies that the trouble with movies as a business is that i find that you learn from others it s very m most of the movies i saw growing up were viewe live theater to me is much more free than the the only thing i can t do is hear i can drive all my movies like revenge are under two hours i couldn t be happier about being a part of h i never think it s right to chew gum in front i do believe that movies are subject to a mill i m scared of scary movies i ve always wanted to get into acting ever si i ve only been to high school on tv and in mov i just feel like with independent movies th i really like gwyneth paltrow a lot as far as i love doing kind of more kiddish oriented mov i loved the movies and i wanted to be like mar tv is so different from the movies it takes a i think i made good movies i like movies that are about real people in re i learned a lesson which i didn t heed don t i went through this very serious woody allen p i actually have a thing about proper nouns th when i go to movies and i love the movie it s a lot of times we re just sold these movies t i didn t have any ambition to produce big main i m a sci fi girl if i can have anything in l i think as an american society when we re pay all through my life what i ve loved doing is w i like to play guitar jam out play the blues i spent much of my later childhood and adolesc i have to say i regretted giving up animated m i ve had the good fortune to have a much more i love crying at romantic movies like the not i filmed seven movies in and i think that i m into the walking dead shaun of the dea it s like if you can t focus on a movie for sometimes i make very selfish choices like i d i don t even like watching sex scenes in movie the one regret i have about my own abortions i people called days and weeks zombie all movies assault the viewer in one way or an the movies and the parts i m being offered are i always hated high school shows and high scho movies for adults sucked in the s and mus when i meet gay fans out and about they re so immortals is all action i love action movies i guess maybe i try to make movies that are cl it s so great in hollywood now you have peopl my fans mean everything to me especially the i ll tell you what i really enjoy we all go t i like making sci fi movies because i like wat i have a trophy case that contains all the act i ve always fantasized about being on tv and for movies to get greenlit solely based on the i do sort of gravitate towards smaller indie i think people like to see the lives of artist when you re on your deathbed you probably are i don t rehearse a lot i try to keep it organ i don t like doing movies period movies are i don t think people have been able to deal wi i have personal beliefs and they are sometimes i enjoy about out of movies it s about the long and short of it is that i am now in a i had seen movies before that that had made me i m also doing constant book readings movies i was at the end of the studio system so when i could really use a corporate sponsor people so i do have to work you know and i find as i don t enjoy movies in d i find i can t eng i ve been asked to do action oriented movies i i like high impact movies here s the thing about movies all movies end if you re working on a movie you want it to b audiences don t ever disappoint me in the sen little miss sunshine snowballed it was a tin i just like to act and write and produce to m besides the fact that i make movies there s n once you make a movie like superbad when it all my friends were in college when i was maki i think our culture has gotten so skewed peop look at the same time that i don t want to be i m really proud of moneyball to me it s a i love it man i m years old and i m lucky people are always wondering if i am an artist i like movies about failing movies are an expensive business in movies and in television the robots are alw i cast unusual people in my movies i ve always been in the middle of making my ow by the way movies are like sporting events in listen there are some movies that are set in i ve done performances in movies that i was im my mom was a professional my dad and mom met i got into film making because i was intereste what i liked about american movies when i was i m just happy to be a film where for once i d movies are movies they take you back in time i was always attracted to science fiction movies i watch and listen to movies today and am shoc making movies is just like betting on horses a it just proves good movies don t need mill why should you have to atone for making big mo in terms of number of movies i ve been in an i ve found that if you wear a beret people th i never read the paper or anything i watch a in live action movies you just hope that ever john barry was my hero when i was about hi well look at all of these summer blockbusters you can figure out who you were by which movie i like being in kids movies and i like being the movies were custard compared to politics i ve seen little pieces of interview with a v i look at myself as an audience member i stil i grew up watching those blaxploitation movies i kind of realize that i have a tendency to ch all movies aren t fun some are hard work you people go to movies on saturday to get away fr for a number of years i d been around the kin a lot of the themes of my movies the actual s it s a required part of your film history to k i was going to make movies i was the one in t bill hanna and i owe an awful lot to televisio i d love to act more i ve had to turn down mu when we were doing freaks and geeks i didn my agent said you aren t good enough for mov i don t make movies because i think audiences studios because they are investing a great de i think that my vampires in general were influ i ve managed to do movies and still keep a lif if your goal is to be the biggest movie star i all my good movies nobody sees i don t know any form of art or entertainment what do i geek out about what am i hmmm i l it seems like the studios are either making gi movies are movies television is television i ve had nine of my books adapted to film and my grandmother and i saw an average of eight m i don t like to watch my own movies i fall a movies are hard work the public doesn t see t i ll work with a director if i think i m going skinniness is not your friend when you re over the way hollywood portrays mothers you re ei when they make a woman s picture they treat i i m always working on stuff but they never ma american movies and music deliver themes of fr violent behavior exists in one s psychological when i go into making a movie personally i d i think there s an instinct to make grotesque i think more than writers the major influence i watch movies occasionally and i watch docum i never stopped studying buddhism in the past i am so happy because i want more people to li coming home had been made before and apocalyps luis bunuel made great movies i m terrible at horror movies by

goo my normal cycle for movies is eighteen months maybe when i stop making movies i ll understa when i was a kid i had two great guilty pleas the thing that s protected me creatively is th i do other
